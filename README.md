Breaking boundaries with Vibe Coding! 🚀
"Vibe Coding" — sounds cooler than ever! 🎶💻
Built my entire portfolio website and deployed — without writing a single line of code — just using bolt.new AI and ChatGPT! 🤯
The result? A stunning Piano-themed UI/UX 🎹 — fully responsive on desktop and mobile — blending music and tech beautifully.
It’s amazing how fast technology is evolving — building websites just by vibing and talking! And honestly, I believe the saying "English is the new coding language" is becoming more real every day! 🌟
